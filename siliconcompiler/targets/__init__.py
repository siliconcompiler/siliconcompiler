def asic_target(proj: ASIC, pdk: Optional[str] = None):
    '''A factory function to configure an ASIC for a given PDK.

    This function acts as a dispatcher, calling the appropriate setup function
    (e.g., `skywater130_demo`, `asap7_demo`) based on the provided PDK name.
    It simplifies the process of targeting different silicon manufacturing
    processes by centralizing the selection logic.

    Args:
        proj (ASIC): The siliconcompiler project to configure.
        pdk (Optional[str]): The name of the Process Design Kit to target. Supported
            values are "asap7", "freepdk45", "gf180", "ihp130", and
            "skywater130".

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided `pdk` name is not supported.
