Quickstart guide
================

If you've completed the :ref:`Installation` section and was able to run the :ref:`ASIC Demo`, you will have completed a simple remote run through an ASIC design flow!

In the following sections, you will find more details about `the design`_, `the flow`_ and `the results`_ of the run.


.. _the design: 

Design Details
-----------------

The simple design that was used in the :ref:`demo target <ASIC Demo>` is a single clock cycle pulse (“heartbeat”) generated by a counter. You can see the design here:  `heartbeat.v <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/examples/heartbeat/heartbeat.v>`_.

.. _the flow:

Run Setup
-----------------

The following python script shows how easily this design is loaded in and run through the :ref:`ASIC flow <asicflow>`.

.. code-block:: python
	:caption: heartbeat.py (remote run)

	#!/usr/bin/env python3

	import siliconcompiler                    # import python package

	chip = siliconcompiler.Chip('heartbeat')  # create chip object
        chip.input('heartbeat.v')                 # define list of source files
        chip.clock('clk', period=10)              # define clock speed of design
        chip.load_target('skywater130_demo')      # load predefined technology and flow target
        chip.set('option', 'remote', True)        # run remote in the cloud
        chip.run()                                # run compilation of design and target
        chip.summary()                            # print results summary

    
In the script above, a pre-existing flow target called :ref:`skywater130_demo` is loaded in, which is specifying a full RTL to GDS run flow, from design synthesis to design placement and routing. 

Notice that in the example above, :keypath:`option,remote` is set to ``True``. This means it's run in the cloud. If you were to remove this, it would run on your :ref:`local machine <Local Run>`.

Run Flow
-----------

Running this python script directly produces the same results as the :ref:`ASIC Demo` target.

.. code-block:: bash
		
	python heartbeat.py


Alternatively, since this is a simple design with just one design input file, you can also run from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash
		
	sc heartbeat.v heartbeat.sdc -target "skywater130_demo" -remote

**Note:** You can use `heartbeat.sdc <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/examples/heartbeat/heartbeat.sdc>`_ for the constraints file; this replaces the clock definition in the python script.

	
.. _the results:

Run Results
------------------------

.. include:: quickstart/quickstart_banner.rst

As the run goes through each step of the flow, a message will be printed to the screen every 30 seconds.

Then, at the end of the run, a summary table will be printed similar to the one show below. This table is generated by calling the :meth:`.summary()` function call in your python script :ref:`above <Run Setup>`.

.. image:: ../_images/summary_table.png

All design outputs are located in ``build/<design>/<jobname>``. When running remote, you will not get all the tool-specific output that you would with a :ref:`local run <Local Run>`, but you will be able to find a screenshot of the demo design ``heartbeat.png`` and a summary report in ``report.html``:

.. image:: ../_images/selftest_screenshot.png


Other Ways to Run
--------------------------
The :ref:`ASIC Demo` was run in public beta server in the cloud. SiliconCompiler also supports running on :ref:`private <private-server>` servers or also local runs on your own machine.

See :ref:`remote processing` to see details on how to run on a private server, and see :ref:`external tools` to see the additional tool installation requirements for running on your machine locally.


Local Run
-----------------------------
If you have the :ref:`prerequisite tools <External Tools>` installed for a local run, you can also give that a try. Local runs are useful if you're interested in more detailed logs and reports for each step run and the ability to browse a gds at the end.

In order to run on your local machine, the only thing you need to do differently than :ref:`the remote run <Run Setup>` is to set the :keypath:`option,remote` to ``False`` in your python script and :ref:`re-run <Run Flow>`.

Or, if you want to run from the command line, just remove the ``-remote`` option.

.. code-block:: bash
		
	sc heartbeat.v heartbeat.sdc -target "skywater130_demo" 



Local Run Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, only the summary of each step is printed, in order to not clutter up the screen with tool-specific output. If you wish to see the output from each tool, you can find the log files associated with each tool in: ``build/<design>/<jobname>/<step>/<index>/<step>.log``

If you wish to see all the tool-specific information printed onto the screen, you can turn the :ref:`quiet` option off.

View Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^
For viewing IC layout files (DEF, GDSII) we recommend installing the open source multi-platform :ref:`Klayout viewer <klayout>`  (available for Windows, Linux, and macOS). Installation instructions for Klayout can be found in the :ref:`tools directory <klayout>`.


If you have Klayout installed, you can browse your completed design by calling :ref:`sc-show` directly from the command line as shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

   (venv) sc-show -design heartbeat

.. image:: _images/heartbeat.png

If you want to have this window pop up automatically at the end of your script, you can add :meth:`.show()` to the end of your :ref:`python script <Run Setup>`.

.. code-block:: python
		
        chip.show()      # pops open a window with the layout
	


What Next?
-----------

Now that you've quickly run a simple example, you can proceed to a larger example like :ref:`building your own soc`, or you can dive deeper into the SiliconCompiler build flow  you ran from this quickstart (`asic_demo <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/siliconcompiler/targets/asic_demo.py>`_) by looking through how the flow is constructed with :ref:`execution model`, :ref:`programming model`, and :ref:`data model` in the Flow Basics section.
