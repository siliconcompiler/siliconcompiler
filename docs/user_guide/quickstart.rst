Quickstart guide
================

If you've completed the :ref:`Installation` section and were able to run the :ref:`ASIC Demo`, you will have completed a simple remote run through an ASIC design flow!

In the following sections, you will find more details about `the design`_, `the flow`_ and `the results`_ of the run.


.. _the design:

Design Details
-----------------

The simple design that was used in the :ref:`demo target <ASIC Demo>` is a single clock cycle pulse (“heartbeat”) generated by a counter.
You can see the design here:  `heartbeat.v <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/examples/heartbeat/heartbeat.v>`_.

.. _the flow:

Run Setup
-----------------

SiliconCompiler includes a Python API to simplify the hardware compilation flow process.
The following code snippet below shows how the :ref:`demo design <ASIC Demo>` was loaded in and run through the Python API.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: heartbeat.py (remote run)

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from siliconcompiler import Chip             # import python package
    from siliconcompiler.targets import skywater130_demo

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        chip = Chip('heartbeat')                  # create chip object
        chip.input('heartbeat.v')                 # define list of source files
        chip.clock('clk', period=10)              # define clock speed of design
        chip.use(skywater130_demo)                # load predefined technology and flow target
        chip.set('option', 'remote', True)        # run remote in the cloud
        chip.run()                                # run compilation of design and target
        chip.summary()                            # print results summary


The following sub-sections will describe each line in more detail.

Object Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hardware build flow centers around the chip data object.
This chip object is instantiated by calling the :py:meth:`~siliconcompiler.Chip` class constructor defined in the :ref:`core api`.

.. code-block:: python

    from siliconcompiler import Chip # import python package

    chip = Chip('heartbeat')         # create chip object

.. TODO It would be good to link to "The Schema" section here once that is completed

Define Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the chip object is created, design parameters can be set up with the chip object's pre-defined functions, or methods.
In this case, the helper function :ref:`.input() <input>` allows you to specify the hardware description input file(s) and the ``.clock()`` helper function allows you to specify the design frequency.

.. code-block:: python

    chip.input('heartbeat.v')     # define list of source files
    chip.clock('clk', period=10)  # define clock speed of design

Define PDK and Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to design parameters, you can also set up your PDK and libraries.
The compilations of this design is using the :py:meth:`Chip.use()` function to load the pre-defined flow target :ref:`skywater130_demo <skywater130_demo>` which is set up to use the :ref:`skywater130 pdk <skywater130>`. This :ref:`pre-built target <skywater130_demo>` is also set up to run a full RTL to GDS run flow, from design synthesis to design placement and routing.
You can take a look at the other :ref:`targets` to see other options for other PDKs and libraries. ::

.. code-block:: python

    chip.use(skywater130_demo) # load predefined technology and flow target


Specify Run Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, the :keypath:`option,remote` parameter of the chip object is directly being accessed by the :meth:`Chip.set()` method to ``True``. This means it's run in the cloud.
If you were to remove this, it would run on your :ref:`local machine <Local Run>`.::

.. code-block:: python

  chip.set('option', 'remote', True) # run remote in the cloud


Design Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that the design compilation is set up, it's time to :meth:`.run()` the compilation and print the results with :meth:`.summary()`. ::

.. code-block:: python

        chip.run()     # run compilation of design and target
        chip.summary() # print results summary


Run Flow
-----------

Running this python script directly produces the same results as the :ref:`ASIC Demo` target.

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 heartbeat.py


Alternatively, since this is a simple design with just one design input file, you can also run from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    sc heartbeat.v heartbeat.sdc -target "skywater130_demo" -remote

**Note:** You can use `heartbeat.sdc <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/examples/heartbeat/heartbeat.sdc>`_ for the constraints file; this replaces the clock definition in the python script.


Remote Run Controls
------------------------

When your job starts on a remote server, it will log a job ID which you can use to query your job if you close the terminal window or otherwise interrupt the run before it completes:

.. code-block::

    | INFO    | job0  | remote     | 0  | Your job's reference ID is: 0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210

You can use this job ID to interact with a running job using the :ref:`sc-remote` CLI app:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Check on a job's progress.
    sc-remote -jobid 0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210

    # Cancel a running job.
    sc-remote -jobid 0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210 -cancel

    # Ask the server to delete a job from its active records.
    sc-remote -jobid 0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210 -delete

    # Reconnect to an active job.
    sc-remote -jobid 0123456789abcdeffedcba9876543210 -reconnect -cfg [build/design/jobname/import/0/outputs/design.pkg.json]

The :ref:`sc-remote` app also accepts a `-credentials` input parameter which works the same way as the :keypath:`option,credentials` :ref:`Schema` parameter.


.. _the results:

Run Results
------------------------

.. include:: quickstart/quickstart_banner.rst

As the run goes through each step of the flow, a message will be printed to the screen every 30 seconds.

Then, at the end of the run, a summary table will be printed similar to the one show below.
This table is generated by calling the :meth:`.summary()` function call in your python script :ref:`above <Run Setup>`.

.. image:: ../_images/summary_table.png

All design outputs are located in ``build/<design>/<jobname>``. When running remote, you will not get all the tool-specific output that you would with a :ref:`local run <Local Run>`, but you will be able to find a screenshot of the demo design ``heartbeat.png`` and a summary report in ``report.html``:

.. image:: ../_images/selftest_screenshot.png


Other Ways to Run
--------------------------
The :ref:`ASIC Demo` was run in public beta server in the cloud.
SiliconCompiler also supports running on :ref:`private <private-server>` servers or also local runs on your own machine.

See :ref:`docker` to see details on how to use the SiliconCompiler docker image to run on tools on your local machine without needing to maintain the tools.

See :ref:`remote processing` to see details on how to run on a private server, and see :ref:`external tools` to see the additional tool installation requirements for running on your machine locally.


Local Run
-----------------------------
If you have the :ref:`prerequisite tools <External Tools>` installed for a local run, you can also give that a try.
Local runs are useful if you're interested in more detailed logs and reports for each step run and the ability to browse a gds at the end.

In order to run on your local machine, the only thing you need to do differently than :ref:`the remote run <Run Setup>` is to set the :keypath:`option,remote` to ``False`` in your python script and :ref:`re-run <Run Flow>`.

Or, if you want to run from the command line, just remove the ``-remote`` option.

.. code-block:: bash

    sc heartbeat.v heartbeat.sdc -target "skywater130_demo"



Local Run Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, only the summary of each step is printed, in order to not clutter up the screen with tool-specific output.
If you wish to see the output from each tool, you can find the log files associated with each tool in: ``build/<design>/<jobname>/<step>/<index>/<step>.log``

If you wish to see all the tool-specific information printed onto the screen, you can turn the :ref:`quiet` option off.

View Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^
For viewing IC layout files (DEF, GDSII) we recommend installing the open source multi-platform :ref:`Klayout viewer <klayout>`  (available for Windows, Linux, and macOS). Installation instructions for Klayout can be found in the :ref:`tools directory <klayout>`.


If you have Klayout installed, you can browse your completed design by calling :ref:`sc-show` directly from the command line as shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

   (venv) sc-show -design heartbeat

.. image:: _images/heartbeat.png

If you want to have this window pop up automatically at the end of your script, you can add :meth:`.show()` to the end of your :ref:`python script <Run Setup>`.

.. code-block:: python

        chip.show()      # pops open a window with the layout



What Next?
-----------

Now that you've quickly run a simple example, you can proceed to a larger example like :ref:`building your own soc`, or you can dive deeper into the SiliconCompiler build flow  you ran from this quickstart (`asic_demo <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/blob/main/siliconcompiler/targets/asic_demo.py>`_) by looking through how the flow is constructed with the :ref:`Design and Compilation Data` and :ref:`Compilation Process` in the Fundamentals section.
