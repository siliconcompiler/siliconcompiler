Command Line Interface
========================

The SiliconCompiler project ships with an easy to use command line application
that encapsulates the project schema and API. All schema entries are directly
accessible through the command line app (but if you find yourself entering
more than 5-10 switches, you should probably consider using the Python API
directly).

* sc <sourcefile> [<switches>]

* Auto-generate all switches
