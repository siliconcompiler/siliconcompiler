**Major:**

* Added basic editing functionality for signoff checklists in HTML report.
* Changed file collection behavior:

  * For local runs, inputs are not copied into import/ at all.
  * For remote runs, inputs are copied into import/0/inputs/ only, not outputs/.

SiliconCompiler 0.9.2 (2022-07-08)
=========================================

**Major:**

* Schema: Added ['option', 'flowcontinue'] to control whether flow continues when a tool reports errors.

  * This used to be controlled by ['tool', \<tool\>, 'continue'], but this parameter is meant to feed directly into tools (rather than controlling the SC runtime).
* Schema: Added ['option', 'continue'] parameter to control whether errors in the Python API are fatal.

  * The default value makes errors fatal, setting this parameter to True reverts to the old behavior.

* Changed Yosys and OpenROAD tool drivers to make them easier to use in flows with alternate step names.
* Changed GHDL tool driver to allow additional CLI options via ['tool', \<tool\>, 'var', ..., 'extraopts'].
* Removed return codes from ``post_process()``.

* Changed ['design'] to be a required parameter for instantiating a Chip.
* Changed error behavior to consistently raise exceptions rather than exit.
* Removed tool script copy feature, so now all EDA scripts are run from the reference directory.

**Minor:**

* Schema: Added ability to store per-parameter designer notes.
* Added offline wheels distribution.
* Added ``read_lef()`` function to help with PDK bring-up.
