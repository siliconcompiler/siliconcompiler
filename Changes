**Major:**

* Added basic editing functionality for signoff checklists in HTML report.
* Changed file collection behavior:

  * For local runs, inputs are not copied into import/ at all.
  * For remote runs, inputs are copied into import/0/inputs/ only, not outputs/.

* Changed ['design'] to be a required parameter for instantiating a Chip.
* Changed error behavior to consistently raise exceptions rather than exit.
* Removed tool script copy feature, so now all EDA scripts are run from the reference directory.

**Minor:**
