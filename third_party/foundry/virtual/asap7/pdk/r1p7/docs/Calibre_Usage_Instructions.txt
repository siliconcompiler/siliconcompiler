* Mentor Graphics Calibre Usage Instructions
*-------------------------------------------

NOTES: 
------ 

1. The Mentor Graphics Calibre files, required for physical verification and
parasitic extraction in this PDK, are not provided as part of the ASAP7 PDK
repository on Github. They must be downloaded from the following webpage:

asap.asu.edu 

Replace the directory "calibre" provided in this Github repository with the
"calibre" directory downloaded (check availability after December 16, 2020)
from the above webpage.

2. This PDK version has been tested with Calibre 'aoi_cal_2017.4_19.14'
and was found to be functional. This PDK version was found to be
incompatible with the xACT extraction engine in Calibre
'aoi_cal_2018.2_52.40'. It is likely that other Calibre versions that
succeed 'aoi_cal_2017.4_19.14' may be incompatible as well.

The Calibre tool environment is available through the Virtuoso toolbar. The
DRC, LVS, and xACT runsets have been supplied with the PDK. 

User is advised to create directories named drc, lvs, and pex in their
local PDK run directory to which they may direct the files generated when
running Calibre DRC, LVS, and xACT, respectively, in order to help reduce
cluttering.

Rule files specific to DRC, LVS, and xACT are required to run the respective
tools and may be found at:

** For DRC:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/ruledirs/drc/drcRules_calibre_asap7.rul 

** For LVS:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/ruledirs/lvs/lvsRules_calibre_asap7.rul 

** For xACT:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/ruledirs/rcx/rcxControl_calibre_asap7.rul 

Specify the above path in the 'DRC/LVS/xACT Rules File' field in the 'Rules'
tab for the corresponding tools. Within the same tab, specify paths to the
drc, lvs, and pex run directories, that were created earlier, in the
'DRC/LVS/xACT Run Directory' field. 

Settings from a particular DRC/LVS/xACT run may be saved as runsets for
later use. Sample runsets are also provided below. However, users are advised
to create their own according to their need. 

** Sample DRC runset:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/rundirs/drc/runset_dir_drc/drcRunset_asap7

** Sample LVS runset:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/rundirs/lvs/runset_dir_lvs/lvsRunset_asap7

** Sample xACT runset:
   $PDK_DIR/calibre/rundirs/pex/runset_dir_pex/xactRunset_asap7

User will need to load the runset the very first time during the
start-up. On subsequent invocation, the user will be presented with a
runset used previously.
