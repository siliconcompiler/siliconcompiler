    This script demonstrates a standard RTL-to-bitstream flow for an FPGA.

    It takes a Verilog design for a simple "blinky" circuit, compiles it
    for a specific iCE40 FPGA part, and generates a bitstream file that

    can be programmed onto the hardware.

    # design (e.g., 'clk', 'led') to the physical pins on the FPGA.

    # Apply this FPGA configuration to the project.

    # that uses open-source tools like Yosys for synthesis and nextpnr
    # for place-and-route.

    # --- Execution & Analysis ---
    # Run the entire FPGA flow. This will synthesize the RTL, place and route
    # the design onto the FPGA fabric, and generate a final bitstream file.
    # The 'assert' will cause the script to exit if the run fails.

    # a report on resource utilization (how many LUTs, FFs, etc. were used).
