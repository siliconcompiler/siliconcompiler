        design.set_topmodule("binary_4_bit_adder_top")

    # Create a standard ASIC project.
    project = ASIC(design)

    # --- Flow Configuration ---
    # Set the project to use the VHDLASICFlow. This is a pre-built flow
    # that automatically inserts a VHDL-to-Verilog conversion step at the
    # beginning, using the GHDL tool.

    # --- Task-Specific Adjustments ---
    # Get the specific task that handles the VHDL conversion (ConvertTask).
    # We then set a tool-specific option on it. The `set_usefsynopsys(True)`
    # option tells GHDL to add a `use` clause for Synopsys libraries, which
    # helps ensure the generated Verilog is compatible with synthesis tools.
    ConvertTask.find_task(project).set_usefsynopsys(True)

    # --- Execution & Analysis ---
    # Run the complete flow. SC will first run GHDL to convert the VHDL
    # file to Verilog, and then proceed with the rest of the ASIC flow.
