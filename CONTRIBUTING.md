How to contribute to SiliconCompiler
=====================================

Thank you for considering contributing to the SiliconCompiler project!

## General guidelines
- Start small, relationships need time to grow
- All new features must come with pytests
- Keep PRs short to simplify review
- Large PRs should be preceeded by discussions
- Discuss with core team before proposing core changes
- PRs should include changes only to files related to change
- Comply with coding guidelines/style of project
- Avoid style only code based PRs

#### Reporting issues

Include the following information in your post:

- Describe what you expected to happen.
- Include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
- Describe what actually happened. 
- Include the full traceback if there was an exception.
- List your Python and SiliconCompiler versions. 
- Check if this issue is already fixed in the latest releases

## Submitting patches

If there is not an open issue for what you want to submit, prefer opening one 
for discussion before working on a PR. You can work on any issue that doesn't 
have an open PR linked to it or a maintainer assigned to it. These show up in 
the sidebar. No need to ask if you can work on an issue that interests you.

Include the following in your patch:

- Include tests if your patch adds or changes code.(should fail w/o patch) 
- Update any relevant docs pages and docstrings.


## First time setup

- Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- Configure your [git username](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git)

- Configure your [git email](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)

```sh
$ git config --global user.name 'your name'
$ git config --global user.email 'your email'
```
- Make sure you have a [github account](https://github.com/join)


## Clone/Fork Repository

- [Fork SiliconCompiler]( https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/fork) to your GitHub account (external contributors only)

- [Clone]( https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) the main repository locally.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/siliconcompiler
$ cd siliconcompiler
```

-  Add fork as a remote to push your work to. (external contributors only)

```sh
$ git remote add fork https://github.com/{username}/siliconcompiler
```



## Instasll Python Requirements

-  Create a virtualenv.
```sh
$ python3 -m venv env
$ . env/bin/activate
```

- Upgrade pip and setuptools.
```sh
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```
   
- Install the development dependencies
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt && pip install -e .
```
  
## Start coding

-  Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on. 

```sh
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/main
```
- Using your favorite editor, make your changes, and [commit](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html#commit-your-changes)

- Include tests that cover any code changes you make. Make sure the test fails without your patch. Run the tests as described below.

- Push your commits to your fork on GitHub (external contributors)

```sh
$ git push --set-upstream fork your-branch-name
```

- Push your commits to your SiliCompiler branch on GitHub (team contributors)
```sh
$ git push -u origin your-branch-name
```


## Running the tests

- Run the basic test suite with pytest.

```sh
$ pytest
```
- This runs the tests for the current environment, which is usually sufficient. CI will run the full suite when you submit your pull
request. You can run the full test suite with tox if you don't want to wait.


## Create a Pull Request

- Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) through github.

## Running test coverage

- Generating a report of lines that do not have test coverage can indicate where to start contributing. 
- Run ``pytest`` using [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io) and generate a report.

```sh
$ pip install coverage
$ coverage run -m pytest
$ coverage html
```
- Open ``htmlcov/index.html`` in your browser to explore the report.

## Running linter

- Running linter on complete project
```sh
$ pylint siliconcompiler
```

- Running linter on a specific module
```sh
$ pylint siliconcompiler/schema.py
```


## Building the docs

- Build the docs in the ``docs`` directory using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).

```sh
$ cd docs
$ make html
```
- Open ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs.
